🏛️ Citizen AI – Intelligent Citizen Engagement Platform
Citizen AI is an intelligent, AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize how governments interact with the public. Built using IBM Granite LLMs from Hugging Face and Flask-free Python, this project enables seamless citizen engagement via real-time chat, sentiment analysis, and actionable dashboards — all deployable in Google Colab.

🚀 Features
💬 Conversational AI Assistant Real-time responses to citizen queries using the ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct model.

😊 Sentiment Analysis of Citizen Feedback Automatically classifies feedback as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english.

📊 Dynamic Analytics Dashboard Visualizes public sentiment trends using Plotly for better policy insights.

🧠 Context-Aware Responses Stores and uses chat history to deliver personalized, context-driven answers.
